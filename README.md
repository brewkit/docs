Welcome to the Brewkit docs! Here you will find a collection of standards and guidelines we recommended for building beautiful and performant web applications. The purpose of these docs is to take some of the guesswork out of deciding what frameworks, libraries, and other tools to use and to provide some sensible solutions to common problems.
  
Of course, every project has some unique requirements and we cannot solve for every problem, but hopefully these docs can provide a solid and proven foundation for you to build upon.
