# The Tech Stack
Here you will find the libraries and frameworks we recommend that have been used together in large-scale production applications.

## Foundational

### [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- **What it is:** TypeScript is an open-source superset of JavaScript that adds static type definitions. Types provide a way to describe the shape of an object, providing better documentation, and allowing TypeScript to validate that your code is working correctly.

- **Why we like it:** In addition to the above, TypeScript includes all modern JavaScript features, is incredibly stable, compiles quickly, and is often much easier to implement than alternative options.

### [React](https://reactjs.org/)

### [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)

### [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
