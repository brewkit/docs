# The Tech Stack
Here you will find the libraries and frameworks we recommend that have been used together in large-scale production applications.



## Foundational


### [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

- **What it is:** TypeScript is an open-source superset of JavaScript that adds static type definitions. Types provide a way to describe the shape of an object, providing better documentation, and allowing TypeScript to validate that your code is working correctly.

- **Why we like it:** In addition to the above, TypeScript includes all modern JavaScript features, is incredibly stable, compiles quickly, and is often much easier to implement than alternative options.


### [React](https://reactjs.org/)

> **Size:** 6.3kB minified, 2.6kB minified + gzipped\
> **Composition:** 100% (self)
