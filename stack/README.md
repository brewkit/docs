# The Tech Stack
Here you will find the libraries and frameworks we recommend that have been used together in large-scale production applications.

## Foundational


### [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

- **What it is:** TypeScript is an open-source superset of JavaScript that adds static type definitions. Types provide a way to describe the shape of an object, providing better documentation, and allowing TypeScript to validate that your code is working correctly.

- **Why we like it:** In addition to the above, TypeScript includes all modern JavaScript features, is incredibly stable, compiles quickly, and is often much easier to implement than alternative options.


### [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)

- **What it is:** webpack is an open-source JavaScript module bundler. It is made primarily for JavaScript, but it can transform front-end assets such as HTML, CSS, and images if the corresponding loaders are included. webpack takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules.

- **Why we like it:** webpack is extremely flexible and can pretty much cater to any build requirement we may have. It can take a fair amount of time and effort to get fully up and running, but it's almost always worth it in the long run.


### [React](https://reactjs.org/)

> **Size:** 6.3kB minified, 2.6kB minified + gzipped\
> **Composition:** 100% (self)

- **What it is:** React is a library for building user interfaces or UI components. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications.

- **Why we like it:** React is lightweight, declarative, and component based which makes our applications easy to write and easy to maintain. It's also maintained by Facebook, so we can be relatively certain it's not going anywhere.


### [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
